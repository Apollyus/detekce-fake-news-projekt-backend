      "The claim that scientists have discovered life on Mars, specifically a new species of aliens, is highly unlikely and lacks credible evidence. While recent studies have identified organic molecules and environmental conditions that could have supported life in Mars' ancient past, there is no confirmed discovery of extraterrestrial life forms. For instance, NASA's Perseverance Rover has collected samples from the Jezero Crater that may contain signs of ancient life, but these samples are still under analysis and have not provided definitive proof of life. ([earth.com](https://www.earth.com/news/nasa-may-have-finally-discovered-life-on-mars/?utm_source=openai)) Additionally, findings of organic molecules and potential building blocks for life have been reported, yet these do not constitute evidence of existing life forms. ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2023/07/12/nasa-discovers-possible-key-building-blocks-for-life-on-mars/?utm_source=openai)) Therefore, the assertion of discovering a new species of aliens on Mars is currently unfounded. \n"
